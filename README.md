# Introduction
Hi, I am Mohammad Arafat Zaman! <br/>

My love for programming began in class 9 when I was introduced to basic coding. <br/> 
Since then, I started my own endeavour in the world of programming, beginning with basic HTML, CSS and Javascript. <br/>

As a university student now, I have grown to appreciate the art of fundamental problem-solving, data structures and alogorithms, object-oriented and functional programming paradigms, and much more.

I am constantly seeking opportunities to expand my horizon in order to **not only** just grow as a *developer* and improve my *technical skills*, **but also** as an effective *changemaker* and *problem-solver* who can tackle any obstacle and *learn* to communicate most efficiently.
